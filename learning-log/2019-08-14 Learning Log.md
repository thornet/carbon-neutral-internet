["What to do when software is heating the world."](bit.ly/hoc-omg-climate) Reading through Chris Adams' great talk at Heart of Clojure. Some nice resources: 
* [The Earth’s Carbon Cycle: Robert Rohde](youtu.be/dwVsD9CiokY)
* [Teaching climate crisis to 4-7 year olds: Prof. JKSteinberger](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1135999007635988481.html). Fun props: a stack of legos, a blanket wrapped around a globe, stickers and detachable polar ice caps.
* [Greta Thunberg: I Am a Carbon Abolitionist.](https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/i-am-a-carbon-abolitionist/). "Only when politicians lose power and businesses lose money by being on the wrong side of the issue will things change. To create that kind of power we must have a mass social movement, and the developments above are potentially the first stirrings of such a movement...History tells us that mass social movements always have a moral argument at their core...Yet despite this history, climate change has largely been litigated on technocratic rather than moral terms. The core argument has been that we should act because the costs of acting are less than the benefits of avoiding climate damage in the future. We should act because it is in our rational self-interest. This framing has been promulgated by economists (William Nordhaus won the 2018 Nobel Prize for developing this argument) and institutions like the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. While the argument is not technically wrong, I can think of no mass social movement that was sparked by a cost-benefit analysis.
* [Nature: Global risk of deadly heat](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3322). At current rates, by 2100, 3 out of 4 people in the world will be facing deadly heat. 
* [Zero Carbon Websites](https://kinsta.com/blog/zero-carbon-websites/). "We cannot manage things that we cannot measure. Data transfer consumes electricity, so reducing data transfer will reduce energy and emissions. Renewable energy produces far fewer emissions than other sources...**The average website produces 6.8 grams of CO2 per page view. This might not sound like a lot but it adds up fast. An average website with 10,000 page views per month would produce 816kg of CO2 per year. That’s more than the emissions produced by a flight from London to Tokyo.** 

    1. Benchmark our website carbon emissions.
    2. Reduce data transfer by reducing page weight and unnecessary page views.
    3. Switch to a web host powered by renewable energy.

Other readings:

* [The Megawatts behind Your Megabytes: Going from Data-Center to Desktop (2012)](https://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2012/data/papers/0193-000409.pdf). Calculations of electricity of all internet usage, inc. devices and towers. "Our  major  finding  is  that  the  Internet  uses  an  average  of  about  5  kWh  to  support  the  utilization  of  every  GB  of  data,  which  equates  to  about  $0.51  of  energy  costs.    Only  38%  of  those costs are borne by the end-user, while the remaining costs are thinly spread over the global Internet  through  which  the  data  travels;  in  switches,  routers,  signal  repeaters,  servers,  and  data  centers  (See  Figure  1  below).      This  creates  a  societal  “tragedy  of  the  commons,”  where  end  users have little incentive to consider the other 62% of costs and associated resources. "

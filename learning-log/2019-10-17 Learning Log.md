The Guardian is amazing and has great coverage and op-eds about the climate and the internet these days: 

* **[Revealed: Google made large contributions to climate change deniers](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/google-contributions-climate-change-deniers).** 
> "Google has made “substantial” contributions to some of the most notorious climate deniers in Washington despite its insistence that it supports political action on the climate crisis."
> Apart from CEI, they include the American Conservative Union, whose chairman, Matt Schlapp, worked for a decade for Koch Industries and shaped the company’s radical anti-environment policies in Washington; the American Enterprise Institute, which has railed against climate “alarmists”; and Americans for Tax Reform, which has criticised companies who support climate action for seeking out “corporate welfare”.
> It has also donated undisclosed sums to the Cato Institute, which has voiced opposition to climate legislation and questioned the severity of the crisis. Google has also made donations to the Mercatus Center, a Koch-funded thinktank, and the Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action, a pressure group that said the Paris agreement was supported by “cosmopolitan elites” and part of Barack Obama’s “destructive legacy”.
* **[In its insatiable pursuit of power, Silicon Valley is fuelling the climate crisis by Rebecca Solnit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/10/power-silicon-valley-climate-crisis-big-tech-profitable)**
* **[‘Tsunami of data’ could consume one fifth of global electricity by 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/11/tsunami-of-data-could-consume-fifth-global-electricity-by-2025)**
> "Billions of internet-connected devices could produce 3.5% of global emissions within 10 years and 14% by 2040, according to new research, reports Climate Home News"

The amazing Climate Action Tech group has **[updated their open letter to AWS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M0emUcXson4j6gGbjQZYJ443wxTQcpz7xrc1vHPF4RQ/edit)** asking for a better commitment off of fossil fuels. It asks Amazon to commit to: 
* All global AWS infrastructure to be 80% renewable by 2024 and 100% renewable by 2030 to be achieved without using carbon offsets
* Provide transparency of what energy mix is provided in all AWS regions through independent auditing 
* Provide a simple way to see our organisations CO2 emissions from existing AWS services by April 2020

Reading *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, which seems so spot on for a lot the tensions around tech and society today. Want to write more about the maintenance mode, how to approach tech in an non-alienating way, and the how mindset affects how tech is made and cared for. 

James Bridle's book *[New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3002-new-dark-age)* looks fantastic. 
> "As the world around us increases in technological complexity, our understanding of it diminishes. Underlying this trend is a single idea: the belief that our existence is understandable through computation, and more data is enough to help us build a better world."

Some people have been talking about the need for more "digestable" info about the internet's emissions. Here's an infographic that does that. Will need to look closer at the sources and framing.

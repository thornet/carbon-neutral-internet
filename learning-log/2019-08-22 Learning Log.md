**[digital.globalclimatestrike.net](https://digital.globalclimatestrike.net/)** is live! Amazing to see all the strike plans, including more and more unions, companies and other orgs joining the strike. 

**[The Planet Needs a New Internet, Gizmodo](https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-planet-needs-a-new-internet-1837101745)**

**[Tech for Future feature in t3n](https://t3n.de/ausgabe/t3n-57-tech-for-future/).** 

Brainstorming within Mozilla about **launching a "bundle" of sustainability initiatives,** from declaring a climate emergency, to releasing a transparency report, to developing a Firefox Eco-Mode and campaigns to move to green data centers. This kind of comprehensive initiative would be amazing!

Reminded about **[Joana Moll's great 2014 project, CO2GLE,  calculating the emissions from Google Search](http://www.janavirgin.com/CO2/CO2GLE_about.html)** (she's got a [fantastic low-carbon website](http://www.janavirgin.com/), btw).  

**Carbon AI and the Concentration of Computational Work.** Very interesting abstract by Naomi Saphra and Kate McCurdy, who's pursuing a doctorate in data science with a focus on natural language technology. In addition to talking about the carbon costs of AI, they make the link between reducing the global population's working hours (for climate reasons) and AI as a labor-saving tool. 

An IndieWeb wiki stub about **[green computing](https://indieweb.org/green_computing).** "Green Computing is practice of using computers and their resources in environmentally responsible way. Community members may try to use renewable energy, recycled computers, owning rather than streaming media, and creating websites with smaller page loads."

**["100 Startup-Gründer starten Initiative für Klimaschutz"](https://www.gruenderszene.de/business/startups-klimaschutz-initiative).** Their website: [Leaders for Climate Action](https://www.leadersforclimateaction.com/). 

**Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam.** [Fellowship application](https://fellows.iass-potsdam.de/application/). Research group on [Digitalisation and Sustinability](https://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/research-group/digitalisation-sustainability). 

More movement around **AWS targeted campaign.** Getting customers together to pressure AWS to move to renewables.

Ola from Climate Action Tech made [a browser plugin that shows you photos of the Amazon when going to Amazon.com.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reclaim-the-amazon/homocecfbbmmljacijppegoeipleelci?hl=en-US) 
 
 Zara Rahman [on the impossibility of flattening our fluid + complex identities into data points.](https://deepdives.in/can-data-ever-know-who-we-really-are-a0dbfb5a87a0) Resonates on many levels but especially in thinking of how friction, slowness, nuance in our tech can bolster our humanity and dignity, rather than being a data point. 

*"The digitisation of our society, of our systems, of our lifestyles, has led us down a path of putting more faith in our technology than we do in those around us, even when those figures tell us something we don’t quite believe."*

Follow-on rec, relevant for the climate impact of using the internet, ["Is tech too easy to use" by Kevin Roose in the NY Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/technology/tech-friction-frictionless.html).  
 
 Possibly good read, too: Astra Taylor's [The People’s Platform,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Platform): ‘While it’s true that anyone with an Internet connection can speak online, that doesn’t mean our megaphones blast our messages at the same volume. Online, some speak louder than others.’

*"Ayodamola Okunseinde is an artist and interactive designer residing in New York City. Okunseinde was researching current projections of the future and found that Africans and people of the African diaspora are largely left out of these conversations. He found this extremely alarming because leaving a culture out of the context of the future or excluding them from narratives of the future is dehumanizing. This leaves a group of people without the ability to dream and imagine themselves in future time-spaces. The ideas and projections of the future of a culture add strength to that culture in the present."* 
 
*"This research culminated in a performance and narrative Okunseinde created in 2015 called The Rift. In this performance Okunseinde plays Dr. Tanimowo, an afronaut from the future who travels back in time to try and understand the collapse of his culture. He collects archeo-biological artifacts from the past to help further his understanding, as well as aid him in critiquing our present. His afronaut suit consists of multiple component parts and is made of a combination of African patterned fabric and other materials from his future time."*

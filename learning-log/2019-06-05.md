* [#OfflineforFuture / #ShutDownforClimate](https://twitter.com/c3sus/status/1135143564890054656): Following the Chaos Computer Club's #gpn19 event, a group of techies (#developersforfuture) are coordinating a website blackout day during the Sept. 20 climate strike. I'm talking with Mozillians if we can join in. [Further notes](https://pad.disroot.org/p/techiesforfuture) from their session, including many German-language resources.
* [carbon.txt @ IndieWebCamp Berlin](https://indieweb.org/2019/Berlin/carbon.txt): Further documentation from Chris Adam's great carbon.txt idea, this time at IndieWebCamp Berlin.
* [Hack4Climate](https://hack4climate.org): United Nations Innovation program for exponential #ClimateAction. #Hack4Climate is a 5-year innovation program (2019-2022) designed to accelerate disruptive and tangible climate solutions at scale. Given the significance of the climate-task ahead and the limited time left, the H4C logic is simple: Only with far reaching, ‘disruptive’ innovation will Paris climate targets be achieved. **Distributed Ledgers, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence** GIZ also involved. Anchored at annual COP climate conferences.
* [Internet Health Report 2018's coverage of internet's electricity usage](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-internet-uses-more-electricity-than/) 
* [Wikimedia's Sustainability Initiative](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_Initiative). Good tracking on goals and progress for the foundation, the community inc. Wikimania, and the website. As well as who is accountable for each initiative. 
* [Mozilla All-Hands proposed session](https://whistlerallhandsjune2019.sched.com/event/Q0Am) on climate crisis and what we as an org can do. 
* **Conferences going carbon neutral**. [A great example of how to do it, inc. the [open code to calculate event carbon emissions](https://github.com/dotconferences/dotjs2018-carbon-footprint), by [Dot Conferences.](https://www.dotconferences.com/2018-review/#carbon). Chris Adams working on a [Climate Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLXw1Qw69zeir3bTM3sbUkszy_RKN5qtWuP-jEbl5BU/edit?ts=5cd3049a#), and I'm helping with some edits and ideas. [Some conference organizers have shared their take on the issue.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HpfdHFiKQxbXizv5BwkjygqfO-Ft7LVeRl8EEGUUdaY/edit#gid=1278478036)   
* Talks. [The ecological cost of software development](https://phpconference.com/agile-culture/what-does-it-actually-cost-an-ecological-price-tag-for-software-development/) and [Code Kills Planet](https://commerce.codetalks.de/speakers#video-w0ngTur5s3A)
* [Climate Choice](https://climatechoice.co/). A list of actions one can take, such as diet, transport, etc.
* [IPCC's report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/) which I should still read (have only seen the headlines). 
* [What a technologist can do about climate change? by Bret Victor.](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/)
* I've been trying out [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/), a search engine based on Bing that plants trees as you search. I'd love a DuckDuckGo x Ecosia mashup.

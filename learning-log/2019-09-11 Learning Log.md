The best performing companies based on a range of climate change measures are also outperforming the stock market, according to research by CDP, formerly known as Carbon Disclosure Project.

Memes and great signage for the #climatestrike on [fridayfuture.love](https://fridayfuture.love/) and [poster maker](https://poster.globalclimatestrike.net/) 

Watching **[Ramez Naam's talk on radical planetary optimism.](http://rameznaam.com/).** The main takeaways is that renewables are in a really disruptive place right now: building a new solar plant is cheaper than building a natural gas or coal one. And the prices are only dropping. See also Naam's writing about *[the third phase of clean energy](http://rameznaam.com/2019/04/02/the-third-phase-of-clean-energy-will-be-the-most-disruptive-yet/)**: "renewables are now competitive for new power even without subsidies in the sunny and windy parts of the world". He has a lot of great charts and stats to back this up and compare prices, energy sources and countries. 

Loved **[Quartz's Ultimate Guide to negative-emissions technologies](https://qz.com/1416481/the-ultimate-guide-to-negative-emission-technologies/)** for summarizing the options, the prices, and the state of development for each. Also helpful was **[Carbon Briefing's 10 options for negative emissions technologies](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-10-ways-negative-emissions-could-slow-climate-change)** from 2016.  

**"The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, and the Oil Age will end long before the world runs out of oil.‚Äù** Sheikh Zaki Yamani, a Saudi Arabian who served as his country's oil minister three decades ago.

**["Oil is becoming uncompetitive even at low prices."](https://www.carbonbrief.org/highlights-the-net-zero-climate-change-conference-oxford)** Report from Net-Zero Climate Change conference in Oxford.

I was at the Mozilla Festival at the end of October, and I have loads to post after that, including the ideas from the Firefox Eco-Mode brainstorm and exciting movement within Mozilla towards emissions reductions. 

In the meantime, some other good projects and links: 

**COP25** is officially moving from Santiago, Chile due to the terrible abuse of police and military power over its citizens. The summit will now be in Madrid. In preparation, another big **[global climate strike is in the works on Nov. 29.](https://fridaysforfuture.berlin/event/global-day-of-climate-actions/)** Conversation also picking up around doing another digital version. 

**[An online petition making the rounds in Germany to label the CO2 emissions on food packaging.](https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/petitionen/_2019/_10/_01/Petition_99915.nc.html)**. Sounds like a wise approach to me. Also interesting to see companies like Oatly promoting it. 

I've been searching for more examples of the positive climate futures, especially building on initiatives already happening. **[This recent film 2040 seems to be a good collection of some of the grassroots, compelling efforts underway globally.](https://whatsyour2040.com/)**

**[Ingrid Burrington's *Everything Has A Resonant Frequency: On Crystals, Networks, and Crystal Networks* at Radical Networks](https://radicalnetworks.org/participants/ingrid-burrington/)**

>"This presentation will explore the history and supply chain networks of high purity quartz, a material central to the manufacture of semiconductors and to the manufacture of new age self-help culture. While the history of the silicon chip has been well-chronicled as a story of lab innovations and industry disruption, the mines that made those chips possible have largely been treated as irrelevant detailsâ€“and today, those mines are often treated as closely guarded industry secrets. In this and many other respects, the semiconductor-grade silicon crystal industry has much in common with the healing crystal industry (which has been experiencing a period of increased popularity thanks in part to the rise of networked digital platforms). By mapping the resonances between these two seemingly opposed crystal economies through archival and field research into both, this talk re-grounds the increasingly everyday experience of using networked technologies in geologic, environmental, and metaphysical dimensions."

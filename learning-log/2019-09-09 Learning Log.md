# 2019-09-09 Learning Log

Visited the opening of the **[Futurium](https://futurium.de),** a new museum and event space in Berlin, over the weekend. Its exhibition design was great: inclusive of different learning styles, accessible language while still presenting nuance and critique. Several sections talked about the energy usage and emissions of the internet. This is increasingly becoming a mainstream concern.

Introduced to the work of Berlin-based **[Creative Climate Cities](http://creativeclimatecities.org/),** an urban planning agency specializing in digital tools, participatory and climate issues. 

Profellow lists a number of **[paid fellowships in climate change](https://www.profellow.com/tag/climate-change-fellowships/).**

Continuing to love the programming of Berlin's **[Nachbarschaftsakademie](https://nachbarschaftsakademie.org/programm2019/),** co-hosted by Prinzessinnengarten. Great tagline, too: "Aus den Ruinen der Moderne wachsen".

Brainstorming with Jon about **"fossil-free IoT"** bringing internet health and carbon neutral internet together. 

**Right to audit:** 
* the decisions of machines
* the labor and materials of machines
* the energy use of machines

**Right to repair**
* ability to repair your IoT devices to extend their lives
* example: e-bike repair. it's a whole need field with battery, electricity, new relationships with Chinese suppliers.

**Right to resell** 
* towards trustworthy secondhand IoT. 
* growing refurbishing business
* laws and "view source" practices that enable repair and resale.  

Project ideas: 

**Secondhand IoT.** 
* Buy Nothing Guides --> Secondhand Buyers Guide! Oxfam can't take on electrical goods because they can't trust them. Teaming up with Restart Project! 
* Generated Vladan style map to understand the audits.  
* Repair business to also do software updates. (links to Consumer Reports). 
* Diagnostics take you to repair knowledge and spare parts. 
* Commission to a security engineer to test/review some of the IoT devices that have been in homes for the last 5 years. Discuss what an update would look like. 

* **[Decrement carbon: Stripe's negative emissions commitment](https://stripe.com/de/blog/negative-emissions-commitment)** "In addition to our offset program, **we are committing to pay, at any available price, for the direct removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and its sequestration in secure, long-term storage.** We’re announcing this commitment to solicit technology partners and to urge other companies to follow suit."
** 1. First, **improving natural carbon sinks** is a goal of current land management projects, such as forestation initiatives, soil management reform, and agricultural techniques. These initiatives are already beneficial today, but there remain open problems on scalably verifying how much CO2 is stored each year and how long it will remain stored. There is an opening for scientists or entrepreneurs to increase the duration of the storage by, e.g., hacking plant roots to store more CO2 for extended periods of time.
** A second set of exciting projects is **enhanced weathering (aka CO2 mineralization).** CO2 in a gas or liquid reacts to form carbonate minerals when it encounters silicate minerals (e.g. olivine) and rocks rich in Ca and Mg. This carbon is then sequestered for centuries+ in the mineral. Such weathering processes operate extremely slowly as natural carbon sinks, and many research initiatives are investigating how to accelerate these processes. Interesting ideas include crushing rock with natural forces and forcing CO2-rich fluids through natural rock formations.
** A third family of exciting projects is **direct-air capture,** such as the prototypes deployed by Carbon Engineering, Climeworks, Global Thermostat, and others. A direct air capture plant is an industrial installation that uses energy (ideally from clean sources) to force air into contact with a CO2-sorbent such as hydroxide solutions or amine-functionalized solids. The CO2 is then separated back out from the sorbent and transported to long-term storage sites. While more research on safe storage is needed, current estimates are that the earth can accommodate tens of trillions of tonnes of CO2 in secure long-term storage, which is many times the amount emitted by human activities to date.

**Carbon capture.** Carbon capture and sequestration technologies are nascent today. While a growing set of startups (including Carbon Engineering, Climeworks, and Global Thermostat) are actively working in the space, there’s no clear market price for permanent CO2 removal. If there was scalable, verifiable negative emissions technology available in the vicinity of $100 per tonne of CO2 (tCO2) captured, **it could be a trillion dollar industry by the end of the century** and complement emissions reduction in halting anthropogenic climate change.
* **[Negative emissions—Part 1: Research landscape and synthesis](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabf9b)** "Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. " 
* **[Negative Emissions Technologies and Reliable Sequestration, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25259/negative-emissions-technologies-and-reliable-sequestration-a-research-agenda)**. "Unlike carbon capture and storage technologies that remove carbon dioxide emissions directly from large point sources such as coal power plants, NETs remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or enhance natural carbon sinks. Storing the carbon dioxide from NETs has the same impact on the atmosphere and climate as simultaneously preventing an equal amount of carbon dioxide from being emitted. Recent analyses found that deploying NETs may be less expensive and less disruptive than reducing some emissions, such as a substantial portion of agricultural and land-use emissions and some transportation emissions.
* **[David Keith’s Carbon Removal Moonshot. The Canadian scientist built a world-class emissions capture project in Squamish.](https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2019/08/16/David-Keith-Carbon-Removal-Moonshot/)** Direct Air Capture vs. carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). "The crucial difference between these two technologies is that CCS captures CO2 exclusively from the exhaust streams of major industrial sources — for example, coal-fired power plants — where carbon dioxide is up to 300 times more concentrated. That makes it a far more efficient place to gather CO2 than ambient air. But even as Alberta and Saskatchewan were gearing up to spend billions of public dollars on the world’s first generation of major CCS projects, climate scientists were starting to worry that the need to capture CO2 would long outlast the need for coal power. For direct air capture, Carbon Engineering would have to move orders of magnitude more air to process the same amount of carbon. But an enormous advantage for DAC was that you were free to install it anywhere on earth so long as a clean power source were available. “You could build a bunch of these air capture projects in the middle of the desert, or in an off-grid area in Alberta that has relatively near-surface big, deep saline aquifers, and you could store your CO2 there,” said Switzer. CCS, by contrast, called for attaching monumental complex infrastructure onto the already monumental complex infrastructure of a power plant, which was in turn often surrounded by the infrastructure of a city...**CCS, by definition, can’t touch what are known as “legacy emissions” — the 750 billion tonnes or so of carbon dioxide that humanity has already put in the atmosphere. But direct air capture would draw carbon directly from the sky. Its theoretical potential was limitless."**
* **[Climeworks](https://climeworks.shop/how-it-works)** Climeworks Direct Air Capture technology captures CO₂ from air. We then mix the CO₂ with water used by a geothermal energy plant and pump it deep underground. Through natural processes, the CO₂ reacts with the basaltic rock – and turns into stone within a few years, permanently and safely.

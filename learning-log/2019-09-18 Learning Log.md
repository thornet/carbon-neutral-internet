Orgs doing various climate work that looks interesting: 

**[Climate Outeach in the UK](https://climateoutreach.org/citizens-assembly-2019-is-the-year-we-finally-start-talking-climate/),** talking about training Fridays for Future national representatives and participating in the UK citizen's assembly about climate. Including their **[toolkit on how to host citizen assemblies for climate talks prepared for the Scottish government](https://climateoutreach.org/resources/scotlands-climate-change-public-conversations-series/)**. Also interesting is their **[Global Narratives project](https://climateoutreach.org/resources/global-narratives-project/)** which  hosts these talks around the world. 

**[Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations (CAST)](https://cast.ac.uk)**. The core partners of the Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations (CAST)  include Cardiff University, University of East Anglia, University of Manchester, University of York and Climate Outreach.

**[The University College London Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/home)**. Changing how public value is imagined, practiced and evaluated to tackle societal challenges. Based at the Bartlett, known for radical thinking of space, design and sustainability. 

**[Climate Analytics](https://climateanalytics.org/about-us/).** non-profit climate science and policy institute based in Berlin, Germany with offices in New York, USA, Lom√©, Togo and Perth, Australia, which brings together interdisciplinary expertise in the scientific and policy aspects of climate change. Our mission is to synthesise and advance scientific knowledge in the area of climate change and on this basis provide support and capacity building to stakeholders.

**[Osney Lock Hydro](http://www.osneylockhydro.co.uk/) is the first community owned hydro scheme to be built on the Thames.   The hydro is now fully operational, generating clean green electricity.

Also: [The Entrepreneurial State: debunking public vs. private sector myths (Anthem 2013) is stirring up much-needed debate worldwide about the role of the state in fostering long-run innovation led economic growth.](https://marianamazzucato.com/entrepreneurial-state/)

And **[danah boyd on The Great Reckoning coming to tech](https://onezero.medium.com/facing-the-great-reckoning-head-on-8fe434e10630).** I think in addition the the abuse, harassment, etc. that tech will come to terms with, we will also reckon with environmental impact and exploitation of people and natural resources.

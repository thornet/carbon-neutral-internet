# Learning Log
*June 6, 2019*

* Looking into Gitlab to host this project. Thanks to Sam Muirhead for his reviews and tips. Also [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) for collaborative markdown. 
* Setting up some issue tracking for project ideas and research. 
* Invited to be a judge in an upcoming [Climate Fixathon](https://fixathon.io/): a global 4-week hackathon for tech makers to help prevent climate breaking down. Organized by Impact Makers. 
* Catching up on all the [great documentation from OMG Climate in Berlin.](https://medium.com/omg-climate) HT to Chris Adams for organizing and curating all the guest posts! 
* [EIT Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/) is a European knowledge and innovation community, working towards a prosperous, inclusive, climate-resilient society founded on a circular, zero-carbon economy. They have research grants and open innovation calls, as well as an office in Berlin. Also organizing a [global climate hackathon  Oct 25.](https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/) 
* Trees of Berlin. I've been curious to also learn more about the nature in my neighborhood. There's an incredible, elegant tree in a square right next to my house. In searching for what it was, I came across Berlin's city tree documentation, including calls to [donate for tree planting](https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/stadtgruen/stadtbaeume/kampagne/start.shtml) (you can even select the tree you want to sponsor), a [database & map of all the trees in Berlin](https://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/index.jsp?loginkey=zoomStart&center=394232,5817915&width=1200&height=800&mapId=k_wfs_baumbestand@senstadt), and a [summary of notable trees in the city.](https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/stadtgruen/stadtbaeume/de/einzelbaeume/index.shtml) Considering trees are one of the best ways of capturing carbon and generally filtering air, etc. it's fun to learn more about them and how to support more of them! 
* [A slow and faraway conversation between Slammer Musuta and Maya Richman](https://medium.com/@sun_chaser/a-slow-and-faraway-conversation-between-slammer-musuta-and-maya-richman-d47311ec65fd). It's been such a pleasure meeting Mozilla Fellows Slammer and Maya, and I'm grateful for their conversational write-up about holistic security and collective care. I think as I move more and more into the world of "open techies for future", it'll be important to learn more about these practices. Their blog post includes a lot of resources they describe as nourishing, such as the [Holistic Security Manual](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/) and [Upturn](https://www.upturn.org/), an org that promotes equity and justice in the design, governance, and use of digital technology. And of course the wonderful [adrienne maree brown](http://adriennemareebrown.net/2019/05/28/relinquishing-the-patriarchy/) Highly recommended. 
* Encouragement from speakers to include the climate crisis (and what you can do) in any talks they give. [James Singleton shares his slidedeck.](https://unop.uk/time-to-react-london/)

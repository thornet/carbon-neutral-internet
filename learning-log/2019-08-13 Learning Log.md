[Global Climate Strike.](https://globalclimatestrike.net/). Plugging into the strike more actively, especially the digital strike side. The digital strike builds on the [Battle for the Net: Red Alert](https://www.battleforthenet.com/redalert/) campaign led by Fight for the Future and where Mozilla was a partner. 

The digital strikes are aiming to uplift the message of FFF and get more people & attention on the global in-person strikes. Websites can easily add a code snippet to their site and join in. Participating sites should [declare a climate emergency](https://climate-emergency.com/) (see this [great B Lab playbook for businesses declaring a climate emergency](https://climateemergencydeclaration.org/business-guide-how-to-declare-a-climate-emergency/) and commit to [Science Based Targets](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/). 

The digital strike will localize in the main languages of the global strike and release the assets openly so that more languages can be supported. 

We're continuing advocating within Mozilla to get involved and I am also pursuing a targeted campaign, likely aimed at data centers, to move to renewables, that we can announced on Sept. 20 as well. 

I signed up as well for one of the [global strike's online trainings curated by 350.org](https://globalclimatestrike.net/online-trainings/) This one will be on escalation. 

Also learning about [Green Web Foundation's growing services](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/services/) to help companies move to renewables. 

Deep notes from collaborators who spoke with data center experts on the environmental impact. Still reading through those now. 

Dipping toes into sustainable web hosts. Examples:

Talking with Jon now that he's back in Scotland: 
* The Reappearing Computer. Design has been complicit in computing becoming invisible. The move of data centers to urban centers. The need to view source! Energy consumption revealed in devices.  
* The Open IoT Studio narrative: responsibility expanded from internet health to now healthy planet.

* [Future Ethics](https://www.future-ethics.com/) Technology was never neutral; its social, political, and moral impacts have become painfully clear. But the stakes will only get higher as connected cameras will watch over the city, algorithms oversee society’s most critical decisions, and transport, jobs, and even war become automated. The tech industry hasn’t yet earned the trust these technologies demand.
* [How to design for sustainability](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/how-to-design-for-sustainability) Tim Frick offers simple tactics to make your own digital products and services more sustainable. O'Reilly.

* [FixFest 2019](https://reparatur-festival.runder-tisch-reparatur.de/) Repair festival planned in Berlin for Sept 20-22. Want to see if we can team up for #climatestrike.

"In 2014, the then mayor of Barcelona challenged cities to produce everything they consume by 2054. Fab City Global Initiative is enabling this shift away from the industrial paradigm of Product-in Trash-out, by enabling the return of manufacture to cities supported by a Data-in Data-out urban model. It comprises a Network of 28 cities, a core Collective and is governed by a foundation. We are working to make locally productive, globally connected cities and citizens."

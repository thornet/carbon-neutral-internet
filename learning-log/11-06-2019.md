* An upcoming Mozilla IRL podcast about the environmental impact of the internet. Good chatter around which browser is more eco-friendly. Suggestions to measure different browsers, trackers vs no trackers, with *also* installing the NOSCRIPT add-on even just with default settings and see how much less network & CPU (electricity) your browsing consumes: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/
* [Offset Earth](https://offset.earth/) a pledge to reduce emissions at a personal level and contribute to the planting of trees. Goal: 1 billion tress ("the success level of Spotify or Netflix"). Btw, [Eden Reforestation Project](https://edenprojects.org/) seems to be the preferred collaborator for these kind of plant-a-tree-to-offset-carbon efforts. Used by Ecosia, too. 
* [Nice write-up from the recent Clean Coffee online meet-up](https://medium.com/clean-coffee/clean-coffee-3-132239eedbab).
* [All the World’s Carbon Emissions in One Chart](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-worlds-carbon-emissions-in-one-chart/) including "percentage of emissions have been created during your lifetime." Put another way, the running total of emissions is growing at an accelerating rate. This is best seen in the dramatic shortening between the time periods taken for 400 billion tonnes of CO₂ to enter the atmosphere:
** First period: 217 years (1751 to 1967)
** Second period: 23 years (1968 to 1990)
** Third period: 16 years (1991 to 2006)
** Fourth period: 11 years (2007 to 2018)
* [I work in the environmental movement. I don’t care if you recycle.Stop obsessing over your environmental “sins.” Fight the oil and gas industry instead.](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/the-highlight/2019/5/28/18629833/climate-change-2019-green-new-deal)
* [Sustainability Discourse Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/SustainabilityDiscourseBerlin/) "Our meetup is a platform which facilitates open-discourse on the topic of sustainability and all that it may encompass. From individual practitioners to the business and governmental policies, we seek to explore their inter-dependency and how our current generation can meet our own needs without compromising the ability of the future generation to meet theirs."

So happy to discover the **[Wikimedia Foundation's Sustainability Initiative.](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Sustainability)** Well documented (of course!), clear goals, and lessons learned: 

>The [ [Wikimedia Foundation's Sustainability Initiative] ](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_Initiative)  currently focuses on three main goals:

>   1. green energy for the Wikimedia servers
>   2. remote participation at Wikimania and other Wikimedia events
>   3. a sustainable investment strategy for the Wikimedia endowment

There is also an **[outline of how they measured and offset Wikimania](https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/2019:Carbon_offsetting)** and a **[talk about how Wikipedia's articles cover environmental topics.](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Climate_change,_civil_engineering,_and_butterflies_-_a_panel.webm)**

*[This poster](https://wikimania2018.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Poster_-_Sustainability_and_the_Free_Knowledge_Movement_-_Wikimania_2018.pdf#file) was created for presentation at Wikimania 2018's Poster Session, and it encompasses the considerations around the environmental sustainability issues of spreading free knowledge through the Wikipedia ecosystem, and the commitments that the Wikimedia Foundation have made toward being sustainable in its mission.*

Enjoying teaming up with **Gabi on the "Micro Climates" project,** making some miniatures that explore the past, present and future of a green internet. Fun spoiler: it may include a Cross-Trainer farm and a solar punk terrarium.  

Talking more with Chris Adams about **a doc sprint for climate action tech.** Considering how to best start: I'm thinking a rough outline, content stubs, some invitations to known collaborators and then a nice readme for others who want to contribute? Ideally we can publish something before COP25. 

Read more from a **[great interview Chris did with The New Stack,](https://thenewstack.io/well-its-a-start-can-tech-stop-the-climate-emergency/)** which also summarizes some of the best resources in this space.

A funny aside: I learned that the **[hipster demand for potted plants has totally caught the planters off-guard.](https://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/mode-design/2019-11/zimmerpflanzen-trend-millenials-topfpflanze-wohnen)** They are surprised to learn that young people prefer to buy from pop-up stores and boutiques rather than the big garden centers.

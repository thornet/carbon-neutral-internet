Great chat today with Chris Adams where we covered a number of ideas:
* **Climate Code of Conduct.** "Preamble, Reduce, Offset, and Teach!" With an appendix of resources and practices. Maybe release a v0.1 at the end of the month and a deliberation process to accompany it and get closer to more organizers being able to sign. 
* **#OfflineforClimate.** We can use an open, easily implementable code snippet so people can blackout their websites. And include in that a link to these other resources about what you can do. 
* **Sustainable delivery and holistic security**. How can we bridge these two practices? They are about organizational cultural change and thinking about the consequences and attitudes for more secure, sustainable products. Opportunity to bring these communities together? Test methodology with an existing team. 
* **Sustainability, IT security and eco-cost.** Example via Jan Peter about a connected fridge: after 2 years, it's a security liability and bad for the internet ecosystem (see Mirai attack). It's not updated nor able to be repaired. But to get rid of the fridge then is an environmental waste. How do we link digital security and sustainability needs? Resources around seeing the cost associated with materials and manufacture. Can we extend to include labor and environmental costs? Especially thinking about connected devices.
* **Towards a new aesthetic.** Bring sustainable web design, responsible IoT and more together. How to demonstrate and teach that? 
* **OMG Climate in other locations.** How to host this conversation in more places, including Mozfest. 
* **[Google Lighthouse.](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)** A tool for auditing a webpage for things like accessibility, performance. Expanded to Greenhouse. 
* **Citizen Assemblies for smart cities.** How do we use this great deliberation tactic from Ireland and beyond to bring citizens into consultation about the smart city (or any topic, really)?
* **#1 Foot High Club.** A funny exchange on Twitter celebrating train travel over airplanes. 
* **More reading.** [Draw Down](https://www.drawdown.org/the-book) book about 100 most substantive solutions to global warming. [ShareAction](https://shareaction.org/) for divestment in fossil fuels. [Sustainable Web Design at the W3C](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/). [The Beam](https://the-beam.com/) is a Berlin-based magazine about climate action. I recommended checking out [Aspiration's facilitation guides](https://facilitation.aspirationtech.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).  

[Carbon footprint of training a single AI model is HUGE.](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613630/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/). Conversation with colleagues about our office's energy consumption, whether we can move to green electricity provider.

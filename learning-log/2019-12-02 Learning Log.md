Thinking about where we could exhibit [Micro Climates](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Projects/Micro_Climates) and came upon **[Museums facing extinction](http://www.wearemuseums.com/museumsforclimate/museums-facing-extinction/)**, part of *We are Museums* and *EIT Climate-KIC*.

**[Appropriate technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology)**. 
> Appropriate technology is a movement (and its manifestations) encompassing technological choice and application that is small-scale, decentralized, labor-intensive, energy-efficient, environmentally sound, and locally autonomous.[1] It was originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist Dr. Ernst Friedrich "Fritz" Schumacher in his work Small is Beautiful. Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasize the technology as people-centered.

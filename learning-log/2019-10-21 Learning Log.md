**[Jasmine Soltani (ITP researcher) presents the carbon footprint of the internet at Radical Networks conference.](https://radicalnetworks.org/participants/jasmine-soltani/)** 

Includes "PhotoLink":

> In the early 1800’s, Jean-Daniel Colladon demonstrated the principle of total internal reflection with water “light pipes” which led to the development of fiber optic cables. Using analog AM lightwave transmitter and receiver circuits from Forrest M. Mims III’s Engineer’s Mini Notebook: Optoelectronic Circuits, PhotoLink shows audio traveling as an optic signal through water laser pipes. Water flows through laminar flow nozzles going in two directions, which carry a visibly modulated signal, demonstrating how fiber optics work. Visitors can have a conversation using speakers and microphones at either end. The majority of the installation is built from reclaimed materials.

**[AI Now: AI and Climate Change: How they’re connected, and what we can do about it](https://medium.com/@AINowInstitute/ai-and-climate-change-how-theyre-connected-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-6aa8d0f5b32c).** Includes recent research on carbon costs of internet and AI, as well as 7 policy recommendations: 

* Mandate transparency
* Account for the “full-stack supply chain”
* Don’t settle for efficiency, and be wary of rebound effects
* Make “non-energy policy” analysis standard practice
* Integrate tech regulation and green new deal policy making
* Curb the use of AI to accelerate fossil fuel extraction
* Address the use of AI to harm and exclude climate refugees

**[C40 Cities and the Global Green New Deal](https://www.fastcompany.com/90414606/the-worlds-mayors-are-calling-for-a-global-green-new-deal)** Mayors from 94 megacities, from Paris to Mexico City, also just declared that the planet is in a state of climate emergency.

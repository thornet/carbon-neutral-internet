This is an open learning log dedicated to understanding the climate crisis and the internet. 

I'm interested in the environmental impact of the internet as well as its contribution to political and social challenges to reaching our climate goals. I also have hope for the potential of the internet to really connect people and be a sort of worldwide empathy network.
